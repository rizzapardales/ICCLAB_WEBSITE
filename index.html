        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <div class="aboutme-content">
            <p>My name is Rizza Mae Pardales, I am first year student at College of Engineering and 
                Technology department of Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. I'm taking a Bachelor of Science in information technology. I chose this course because it amazes me how our technology
                now is powerful. IT professionals were required in every industry, including business, healthcare, and finance.
                To know more about myself I like cats and have two of them named Pochy and Haru.Every time I go outside
                I always bring catfood in my bag so I can feed stray cats that I meet in the street. Also, my hobby is
                digital sketching I discovered this skill when the pandemic started because, out of boredom, I tried something new, so I tried digital
                I didn't expect to be good at drawing when I started sketching. </p>

                <img src="images/one-of-us-is-lying.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The story has a perfect mix of drama, suspense, mystery, and romance, and I haven't read 
                    anything quite like it. I couldn't put this book down, I was constantly on the edge of my
                     seat, waiting to see what happened next with the characters. It shocked me when they finally 
                     figured out what actually happened to Simon, because it was definitely not what I was 
                     expecting. I can't wait to read the sequel, "One of Us is Next". There were a lot of things 
                     in this book that I never saw coming, but they added much more dimension and detail to each 
                     of the four main characters.</p>

                <p>This book is awesome and I definitely recommend reading one of us is next and one of us is lying.
                    It hooks you in from the beginning and only gets better. The ships are awesome too.
                    The only thing that would make it better is a sort of epilogue as there are a few characters
                    story's which have not yet been fully completed and there are relationships that are left on a
                    bit of a cliffhanger. Other than that this book is great. I would recommend it to people 12
                    and up who love mystery, thriller, adventure, and danger.</p>
